## The Facts

### Lack of Travel Among US Citizens
Only 43% of US citizens hold a US passport, which is a rapidly decreasing percentage since the 70s. This is in stark contrast to the passport holding percentage of 60-70% of Canadians, and 70-80% of Europeans, Australians, and New Zealanders. It's also estimated that one in nine Americans will never leave their own state. This lack of travel has become a problem for the US as a nation.

### Why is it a problem?

The issue lies in the belief among many Americans that America is good enough and that there's no reason to leave it. However, this belief is a myth that is causing us to close ourselves off from the rest of the world.

Without experiencing other cultures, how can we create international policy or be empathetic to people who have been scarred by war? How can we engineer some of the world's greatest innovation if we're sitting comfortably in a bubble that's growing?

It's not uncommon for Americans to dismiss the idea of traveling to certain countries due to perceived dangers, cost barriers, or lack of time. However, we tend to overestimate the danger of most international locations, we overestimate the cost barrier to entry, and we overlook the utility of planning an international trip.

The bottom line is that we need to encourage more US citizens to travel and experience the world outside of our own borders.
